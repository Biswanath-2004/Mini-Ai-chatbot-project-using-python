# Mini-Ai-chatbot-project-using-python
 I build a mini Ai chatbot that can interact with users,the chatbot will understand simple messages   like"hello","motivate me",or "python" and respond with friendly ,intelligent answers.  this is a rule-based=chatbot,it does'nt use real ai models yet,but behaves intelligently using python logic.
